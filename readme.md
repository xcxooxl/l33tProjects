## Welcome

Welcome to my projects repo =] !
Here I will post some projects I have been working on.

## faceProxy

credits for the proxy : https://github.com/justcoding121/Titanium-Web-Proxy


What does faceProxy do?

1. it opens a proxy on target computer
2. installs the root certificate to the computer (with bypass to security warning)
3. when user enters www.facebook.com it grabs his cookies.
4. it will send SCARY messages to whoever you specified in the console.

Hacking your computer...

2*5=10 Hex = 000000020x

10*5=50 Hex = 0000000A0x

50*5=250 Hex = 000000320x

and so on.. of course this doesn't realy hacks him.. just send messages.

## Important

This project should be used only for educational purposes.


## Update.

Seems Facebook upgraded their security.. added more checks etc. (SignatureId, etc .. )

And I don't wish to play this mouse-cat game.

But the idea remains the same.. when you open a proxy on a client machine you can in fact send requests to any site as them.

And you probably don't have to send requests straight to the server.. you can probably just modify the response of the page and add your custom JavaScript to launch whatever code you want.

Still. Well Played Facebook. (if they found my code in less than 48 hours.. I am impressed =]).
